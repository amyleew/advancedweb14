  <p>Building out the design and then incorporating my design to my functional mocks is proving more challenging then I suspected. I am starting over with my functional page. I wanted to make a new branch on github but that also proved too confusing so I made a new repo. Hopefully I can get my design built in then move on to some of the functionality.</p>

 <p>Here are my design mocks:</p>

<h3><a name="hello-git" class="anchor" href="#hello-git"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Post 6 :: Re-cap of Assignment 1 part 3</h3>

  <p>I have a few goals for the UI / experience of my online library; 1) the visual effect of physical depth 2) browsing options similar to picking books from nearby shelves, 3) membership benefits which keep them logged in... like tailored recommendations and notes. I also want to utilize the online magic of filtering making it fun and cool to search, browse and find new books.</p>

 <p>The basic framework is <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. My goals this week was to capture the tasks and goals that visitors can accomplish on these pages. Then next week try to implement some of the more advanced features. I've been tinkering with <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">Isotope</a> and <a href="http://mixitup.io">MixItUp</a> to work in the filter system. I'm also desiging that system complete with words and color-coding.</p>

<p>But for now... check out my wireframes: <a href="http://amyleew.github.io/Re-Stacks/">http://amyleew.github.io/Re-Stacks/</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="hello-git" class="anchor" href="#hello-git"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Post 5 :: Cool Web Thing</h3>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, a read / write web site that hosts, "everyone's stories and ideas" is very nice. I pretty much love everything about it's simplicity of design and intuitive interface. I particularly love the way notes are nested on the side of the reading interface. You just see little comment marks and with a few clicks can see how many notes were left. Along with the quick access to leaving your own notes. Simple and elegant. Love it!</p>

<p>These are style tiles for the Enoch Pratt RE: Stack web design. I'd like to design the feeling of searching through volumes of books and navigation deeper into and out from text and content. These are prelimary tiles of looks I'm exploring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a>, is a simple app for the iOS that tracks your location continuously, uses very little power and is designed to run in the background.</p>

<p>This app is designed not to visualise data but encourage developers to use Moves API to download the data and map it as they please. Very open source. And then, Nicholas Felton created a Processing application, <a href="https://github.com/feltron/MMapper">MMapper</a>, for the Moves.app API to collect and map the places, distances and gps coordinates data.</p>

<p>The Enoch Pratt RE: Stack is an initiative to bring the index and access of the Public Library to a computer, device or mobile interface near you.</p>

<p>Think Dewey Decimal Classification system, intelligent web bots, every helpful and knowledgeable librarian youâ€™ve ever met and avid to casual readers young and old. The focus is to create an interface that promotes connection between readers, the wealth of library knowledge and the joy and curiosity of reading.</p>

Blog Post 1 :: One Cool Thing Interactive</h3>

<img src="images/onething/01_socialCapital/01_readwrite_logo.jpg">

ReadWrite one of the most widely read and respected tech news sites in the world uses social capital as a link builder. They have a little visual treatment for each article thumbnail image and title that shows how many readers have clicked to read the article. Strong and smart way to show the readers what's popular and trending among the other readers. Very prominently shown and most likely dynamic.

<img src="images/onething/01_socialCapital/03_readwrite_Link.jpg">

When reading the article, you also see dynamical social capital be used to show how many readers have share among twitter, facebook, etc.
